1) why version control?

	From https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control:  
	Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

	Also very useful as universal storage/repository for your work/courses/etc.

2) installing git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

3) setting up GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git

4) connecting and interacting with GitHub  
	- https://desktop.github.com/  
	- http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/common-git-commands.html

5) VS Code integration with GitHub: https://code.visualstudio.com/  

	VS Code is a free IDE from Microsoft. I find it useful for multi-language coding. Examples:
	- CSE6242, which uses Python, SQLite, Java, JavaScript, etc. 
	- ISYE6740, for producing PDF reports using Markdown and LaTeX

	You can do it all in the same IDE without learning a new tool for every language. I use VSCode for everything except R coding (RStudio is my preferred choice for R: https://rstudio.com/, due to its Shiny publishing capabilities).
